# Scherzer Bascule Bridge

## Overview
This project is a functional scale model of a **Scherzer rolling lift bascule bridge**, developed for the *Electrical Machines and Drives* course at the National University of Science and Technology Politehnica Bucharest.

The model realistically simulates the operation of a **half-through single-leaf Scherzer bridge**, combining **3D modeling**, **3D printing**, **TinkerCAD circuit simulation**, and **Arduino UNO control**. It integrates mechanics, electronics, and programming into an automated system.

## Team
- **Tudor Popanica-RÄƒboj** â€“ electronic circuit simulation, component selection, Arduino programming, breadboard assembly
- **Ion Andrei-Sorin** â€“ 3D design in Fusion 360, 3D print preparation, Arduino code implementation
- **Both** â€“ final assembly, testing, mechanical & electronic adjustments, documentation

---

## Objectives
- Build a working Scherzer bascule bridge model at reduced scale
- Implement an **automatic safety system** with barriers, lights, buzzer, and limit switches
- Integrate modern tools: 3D modeling, 3D printing, TinkerCAD simulation, Arduino programming
- Demonstrate an interdisciplinary approach (mechanics + electronics + software)

## Features
1. **Barrier System** â€“ two SG90 servo motors (90Â°) for vehicle stop barriers
2. **Warning System** â€“ LED traffic light module + buzzer
3. **Bridge Actuation** â€“ SG90 servo motor (360Â°) with gear and threaded rod mechanism
4. **Control Interface** â€“ two push buttons for process sequencing
5. **Central Control** â€“ Arduino UNO powered by 9V battery

## Testing
- **TinkerCAD simulation** to validate control logic
- **Individual component testing** (servos, LEDs, buzzer, limit switches)
- **Integrated testing** for complete operational sequence
- **Stress tests** with 20+ continuous cycles

âœ… The bridge model operates reliably, simulating a real-world automated rolling lift bridge in a compact educational format.
